## Last Few Week's Accomplishments

The **SPA** rewrite is underway and making phenomenal progress, much faster than before when we were using Koa for to render views. I've set up Vue with Webpack, vue-router, vuex, and axios. Auth is working, API calls work, getting user info including assignments and course schedule works great. I developed a basic sidebar showing the user's course list. I set up a basic assignment list page and the ability to add assignments and remove them.

## Blocks
Unfortunately, I am the only one on my team who has had any previous experience with Vue so now everyone has to catch up.
