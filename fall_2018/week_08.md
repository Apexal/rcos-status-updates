## Last 2 Weeks' Accomplishments

The last two weeks have been phenomenally productive and great strides have been made on the site. Team meetings on Saturdays have proved very helpful
not just in programming but in feature planning and brainstorming together. The main algorithm that will make the automatic scheduling
possible is finally being discussed and developed. The website now has full assignment CRUD operations, an advanced filtering system, a browsable archive
of past assignments, and a calendar for overviews of due dates.

## This Week's Plan

Over break I've put together a large feature/bug list to get through and am making headway in my spare time.
I currently use **LATE** as a assignment tracker personally so I am thoroughly testing it and finding improvements through daily use.
