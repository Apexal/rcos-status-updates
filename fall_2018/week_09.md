## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week was phenomenally productive over Thanksgiving break! I had compiled a list of features to implement and bugs to squash over the break and was able to get through 99% of it and implement the start of integrations for LATE.

## This Week's Plan

I spoke with Alex during the small group meeting and he offered many helpful tidbits of code I can use to refactor and clean up the code base. This week I will focus on that.
