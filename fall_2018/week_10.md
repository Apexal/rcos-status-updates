## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I was quite busy with schoolwork but managed to contribute a significant number of commits focusing on general improvement and bug fixes for LATE.
We are getting very close to the presentation date so I want to have everything perfect so the demo can be impressive as possible.

The site is currently perfectly usable as an efficient and detailed assignment planner (though the assignment auto-scheduling is not yet fully implemented).

## This Week's Plan
This week I will focus on making the presentation slideshow perfect and squash any remaining bugs before the demo.
