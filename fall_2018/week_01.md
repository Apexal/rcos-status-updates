## Last Week's Accomplishments

I found difficulty organizing and communicating with my team at first due to our size of 12 members and since we are split up unevenly in the small group meetings. However, I have made sure everyone is on Slack in our channel, have setup the repository with links to necessary learning materials, and I am trying to organize weekly big meetings outside of Tuesdays.

## This Week's Plan

I will setup the repo, add everyone as collaborators on the repo, and try to schedule a weekly weekend meeting.

## Anything Blocking?

Team size is currently the only limiting factor but this is mainly due to my inexperience working with large teams (or teams at all!) and will be fixed in time.
