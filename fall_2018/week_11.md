## The Final Week

This week was again wonderfully productive. Alex gave me feedback on code quality and structure, which prompted me to restructure the entirety of the server to follow a more consistent pattern where models, controllers, and routes for each item and kept in the same place instead of separated. This already proves to be quite helpful. We have hit 600+ commits at this point and I am amazed at the shear amount of time I have poured into this project already. The presentation we had on Friday was way too short to really summarize 3 months of progress so it was kind of a waste, but it is out of the way. I have compiled a huge list of issues to work on over break so that when next semester starts, I will be able to recruit some friends as BETA testers. I already have about 3 people who have expressed interest and are just waiting for the url.
