## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week proved quite productive in terms of organizing the team and getting everyone on the same page. We were finally able to agree on a weekly Saturday meeting where the entire team meets in my classroom in Bray Hall to discuss and work together. We met for the first time and a surprising 10 out of 12 people showed up! I didn't expect such a good turn out and was pleasantly surprised by how productive the meeting turned out to be. We sat down to determine the sub-teams, front end and back end, and discussed our general goal for LATE and what to expect from a LVP.

## This Week's Plan

I have guaged everyone's experience with coding and development through discussion and a Google Form I made for the team. I have sent links for learning HTML, CSS, Javascript (specifically NodeJS) so everyone can get up to date.

## Anything Blocking?

Currently the only block is lack of experience for most team members, which just means more time will be spent teaching, which is fine!
