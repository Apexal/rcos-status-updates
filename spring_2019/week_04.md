## Last Weeks's Accomplishments

Over the past week I made 30 commits adding a variety of new features and fixing a variety of bugs. I completed the Spring Break Milestone and started working on it. I updated the exam system API and views to match the features of assignments. I refactored lots of the AssignmentOverview into assessment-agnostic components that both assessment overviews now use so that the ExamOverview can't really fall behind. I also fixed the incorrect SIS PIN bug. I also (with much difficulty) worked to web scrape the RPI period list table site to automatically get the period types for each course period when a user sets up their account. On top of this I also took up the mantle for reworking the busy blocks, starting by allowing them to be named.

## This Week's Plan

I will continue to work on the Spring Break Milestone throughout the week.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing at all. Great time for a break!
