## Last Weeks's Accomplishments

I fixed some bugs in Google Calendar which some testers found. I also started and finished revamping the exam modal to use the updated system of steps. This required a lot of refactoring of the modal components so that they work for both assignments and exams. It was a good way to clean up code! I also went around improving sidebar components to be a little cleaner.

## This Week's Plan

I will revamp the assessment overview components to give a clearer visual design for assignments and exams, since I think the current design is too colorful.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing at all.
