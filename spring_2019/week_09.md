## Last Week's Accomplishments

The past two weeks have been very productive. The Coursework systems has been reviewed, merged, and cleaned up by the team. The announcement system has been cleaned up as well and merged. The new unavailability systems has also been merged.

I totally revamped AssessmentsFilter to be a collapsible box with a few filters inside, saving space and on the coursework pages. I also went through all the components used by the newly made AssessmentsOverview page so that `assessmentType` is not a prop as it is now stored on the database models themselves.

I also added a new sidebar tab which is just a simple course list that opens the CourseModal for each course.

I also recorded a 7 minute long update video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3RLHVNB81w

## Next Week
Next week I will work with Ally on the stats page, teaching her how to use Charts.js to graph interesting and visual relationships such as course to # of assignments, days to # of assessments, etc.
