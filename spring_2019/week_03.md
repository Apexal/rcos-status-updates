## Last 2 Weeks's Accomplishments

Over the past two weeks I made about 100 commits. I developed the admin page further to allow locking or deleting user accounts. I added comments to Exams. I redesigned the comments component for assessments. I added a whole new way to group Upcoming Assignments by course instead of due date. I adde the ability to schedule work blocks right from the Dashboard. I added a progress bar for all API calls. I squashed a handful of bugs and approved and merged a handful of pull requests!

## This Week's Plan

I will compile the final milestone for my Spring Break so that I have clear things to work on in my free time.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing at all.
