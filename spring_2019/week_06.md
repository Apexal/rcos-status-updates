## Last Weeks's Accomplishments

***GOOGLE CALENDAR***
I sat down and knocked out the foundation of Google Calendar integration in about 40 minutes yesterday. I was planning on it taking a few weeks... Users can now connect their Google Accounts and give LATE access to read their calendars and create/edit/remove events. I have working implementations of adding GCal events connected to work blocks being added/edited/removed.

## This Week's Plan

I will continue to work on Google Calendar integration this week as I promised to testers that it'd be ready by Monday ðŸ˜¬

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing at all. Beautiful weather!
