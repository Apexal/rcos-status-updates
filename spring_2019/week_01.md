## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I made an admin page, shut down the entuire public server and made a waitlist, and I redesigned the AssignmentOverview page. All together I made about 50 commits.

## This Week's Plan

I will continue to develop the Admin page to implement user actions like toggling the account lock on users, removing users, etc. I will also continue making more Issues to delegate to the team. I will work on the Issue list as I have been doing.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing at all.
