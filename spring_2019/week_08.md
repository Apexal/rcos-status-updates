## Last Weeks's Accomplishments

This last week was a busy one! Assignments and exams are going to be merged into one "Work" system to simplify things and pave way for extra systems that cover more than academic systems. I revamped the entire unavailability system so that busy blocks are no longer stored on the user model but in their own model. I created backend routes, frontend routes, and the schema for busy blocks. I realized this is a big change that resets everybody's unavailability if they've put it in.

I decide to create an Announcement system that allows admisn to post announcements for all users to see.

## This Week's Plan

This week I will start testing the Announcement system, merge the new unavailability system, and work on new features and bugs proposed by testers.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing at all.
